- [Commentpress](http://futureofthebook.org/commentpress/) is a Wordpress plugin to write a book online. Some nice examples in action:
  - [The Historian's Macroscope](http://www.themacroscope.org/?p=1)
  - [Holy of Holies](http://futureofthebook.org/mitchellstephens/holyofholies/) (appears to be an earlier theme, but I like it better than the current default.)

- [Scalar](http://scalar.usc.edu/)
  - My first Scalar book: [UNOBTRUSIVE MEASURES ONLINE: OPEN SOURCE INTELLIGENCE FOR INVESTIGATORS AND SOCIAL SCIENTISTS](http://scalar.usc.edu/works/unobtrusive-measures-online/index)
  - I like Scalar, but now I want to publish the same material as an E-book. I haven't yet found an easy way to get my stuff out of Scalar and into another format.
