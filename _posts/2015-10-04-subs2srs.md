Making audiovisual Anki flashcards from episodes of "Avatar: The Last Airbender".

1) Using "The Complete Book 1 Collection", which has French and Spanish audio tracks as well as English. (Note: I have not checked all of the episodes in the box for Spanish audio.)
2) Rip the DVD to my hard drive using DVDFab (the free component only). Don't save the video to my network drive--it will exceed my storage quota. Took about 30 minutes.
3) Use Handbrake to pull out Episode 1 and convert it to MKV format.
4) Use subs2srs to create the Anki flashcards.
5) Set the Avatar deck to add only five new cards a day. I study each one carefully until I've learned it (assuming I don't delete or suspend it if I don't like it).
