## Tools to learn Spanish pronunciation
I began with Gabe Wyner's Latin American Spanish [pronunciation trainer](https://fluent-forever.com/pronunciation-trainers/#.Vg8EQMtJaa0). This is more for training your ear to hear the fine points of Spanish pronunciation. I don't think it's a big help in spoken pronunciation, unless you specifically model the sounds you hear. because Gabe has downloaded is sound clips from Forvo, the quality is variable. There are different accents, which for a beginner is mor eharmful than helpful. I especially found the variation in pronouncing the "ll" sound to raise questions. While it is a nice product and may be useful for rarer languages, for Spanish I don't think it's a necessary buy, because there are free alternatives that do the same:

-StudySpanish.com has a nice pronunciation [module online for free](http://www.studyspanish.com/pronunciation/).
-University of Iowa also has a free online [Spanish pronunciation trainer](http://soundsofspeech.uiowa.edu/spanish/spanish.html). Here is [the older version](http://dialects.its.uiowa.edu/#), which is also useful.
-The US State Department's Foreign Service Institute language programs also begin with pronunciation. Most of these are available online for free. There are a number of FSI Spanish courses, and at least two of them have extensive pronunciation training: the [Basic course](http://fsi-languages.yojik.eu/languages/spanish-basic.html), and the [Programmatic course](http://fsi-languages.yojik.eu/languages/spanish-programmatic.html).

[Tongue twisters](http://www.spanishpronto.com/spanishpronto/SPBS-2011-000-002.html) from SpanishPronto.com.

-A simple sentence used to teach these to young children in Spanish-speaking countries that uses all 5 vowels plus the double “rr” is “El burro sabe más que tú”

To practice "r"s:
Erre con Erre Cigarro
Erre con Erre Barril
Rápido ruedan las ruedas (or, Rapido corren los carros)  
Sobre los rieles del ferrocarril
or, Rapidos ruedan los carros cargados de azucar al ferrocarril.
