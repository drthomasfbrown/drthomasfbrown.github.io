This is how I made more than 500 audio sentence cards in Anki for my Spanish study from a Youtube video--in only about two hours. And much of that time was spent waiting for programs to run--I wasn't working the whole time.

Each flashcard features a snapshot from the video on the front, and an audio recording of a sentence. On the back of the card is a transcription of the target sentence in Spanish, with the line before and the line after given for context. At the bottom are the same three lines translated into English.

This method only works with Youtube videos that have a "CC" button to turn the subtitles on and off. While this means that this method does not work with every Youtube video, there is no shortage of excellent study material on Youtube that does feature CC subtitles.

1. I used [Download Youtube Videos as MP4](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/download-youtube/) to download a [documentary of Latin America](http://www.rtve.es/alacarta/videos/historia-de-america-latina/historia-america-latina-poblamiento-america-latina/1780890/) in Spanish from Youtube.

2. Pasting the video's URL into [keepsubs.com](http://keepsubs.com/) results in a downloadable subtitle file in .srt format.

-- Some Youtube videos have subtitles in more than one language. It may be possible to download both subtitle files separately? That would be very useful to have timed and translated subtitles.

3. That .srt subtitle file can be opened in [Subtitle Edit](http://www.nikse.dk/subtitleedit/). This program will also generate an automatic English translation of the Spanish subtitles, using the Google Translate engine. I saved the Spanish and English .srt files separately.

-- On the Tools menu, you can automatically merge short lines together. Adjusting the settings will affect how many lines are merged. I was not able to find a way to manually select two lines and merge them.

-- You can edit the translations in this program. But with around 600 lines in the 52-minute video, it was too much for me to do by hand at this stage in the process. If I come across some cards that I especially like but that have problematic translations, I can always tweak the translations down the road.

4. I used Handbrake to convert the downloaded video into MKV format.

5. I used subs2srs to create Anki cards out of the MKV video and the two .srt subtitle files. While in subs2srs, I browsed through the cards using the Preview feature, and deleted some obviously bad ones. I also did a little editing of the translations.

6. Import the subs2srs output into Anki.

Not all of the Anki cards thus generated were usable. Some were more or less noise. Others had terrible translations that weren't worth fixing. Many are simply too difficult for me right now. At this stage in my progress I'm looking for cards that are either easy, or that I can decipher with the help of dictionaries and Google Translate. But setting aside this problem cards, this 52-minute video still resulted in well over 500 useful audio sentence Anki cards.

Not all are complete sentences. Still, I think the sentence fragments are worth studying. The fragmentation is most often deliberate--not a result of my technological process. The documentary features some rather poetic narration, in beautifully written Spanish. It also features some more academic and analytical language, mostly in the interviews with academics. And the narrator speaks clearly and relatively slowly -- good for a Spanish beginner to decipher.

In summary, this is a very good way to generate i+1 comprehensible input. With two hours of work, I have over 500 audio sentence cards to study.
