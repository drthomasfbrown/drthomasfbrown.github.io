* [Text Analysis with Topic Models for the Humanities and Social Sciences](https://de.dariah.eu/tatom/) by Allen Riddell. A series of tutorials on including preprocessing, computing text similarities, and finding distictive words.
* [A Smattering of NLP in Python](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/charlieg/A-Smattering-of-NLP-in-Python/blob/master/A%20Smattering%20of%20NLP%20in%20Python.ipynb) by Charlie Greenbacker. The basics of using NTLK to analyze text documents.
* [Using Pandas to Curate Data from the New York Public Library's What's On the Menu? Project](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/gist/trevormunoz/8358810) byTrevor Muñoz. People spell potatoes au gratin a lot of different ways.
* [Statistical Natural Language Processing in Python](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/url/norvig.com/ipython/How%20to%20Do%20Things%20with%20Words.ipynb) or How To Do Things With Words. And Counters. or Everything I Needed to Know About NLP I learned From Sesame Street. Except Kneser-Ney Smoothing. The Count Didn't Cover That. by Peter Norvig. This actually isn't that useful to social scientists, but his code is beautiful.
