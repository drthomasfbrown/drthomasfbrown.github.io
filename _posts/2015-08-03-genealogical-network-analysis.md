Notes from White & Johansen:

* The common anthropological idea of representing culture by a shared set
of rules, in Leaf’s view and ours, is largely a façade. Behind the appearance
of shared cultural or institutional forms for any given community or
society there lies far more heterogeneity and structural variability than
the anthropological construct of “shared rules” is wont to admit. (p. 39)

* Moody and White (2003) found multiconnectivity
and social embeddedness—the deepest k-components to which actors
belong (for higher values of k-connectivity) in larger cohesive groups—
to outperform many other potential predictors of downstream consequences [...] Many of our hypotheses concern the feedback relationships between
individual decision making and their social embeddedness. We
also look at group-level processes, such as how people “vote,” via their
network behavior, for the emergence of leaders, how such group-level
processes interact with individual level characteristics, such as those of
emergent leaders, and the way that emergent leaders were embedded in
the network. (pp. 46-47)
