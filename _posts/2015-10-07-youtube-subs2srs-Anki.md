Hacking a bit 'you can also create a deck with YouTube videos, but we need to extract the subtitles and the video. I tried different solutions to find the process as easy as possible. To extract subtitles I used a program called [Google2srt](http://google2srt.sourceforge.net/en/) , very simple to use, for the videos I looked for a plugin that works.
Just the interface of YouTube has changed and most of the plugins are not working. I found Firefox works purely [Download Youtube Videos as MP4](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/download-youtube/)
