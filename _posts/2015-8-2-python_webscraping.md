Five web scraping lessons from [The Programming Historian.](http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/)

[With Pyton, from Neal Caren:](http://nealcaren.github.io/python-tutorials/)
When they don't want to give you the data, you can sometimes grab it anyway by visiting one or more web pages and then extracting the parts you need. [requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/) is a useful library for accessing web pages, and [BeautifulSoup](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) is a popular choice for pulling out the good stuff. If you don't know any HTML, regular expressions can sometimes work well too.

* [Intro to Beautiful Soup](http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/intro-to-beautiful-soup) by Jeri Wieringa. Turning a table on a website into a CSV file. Part of the useful [Programming Historian](http://programminghistorian.org/) set of tutorials.
* [Scraping Craigslist](http://www.gregreda.com/2014/07/27/scraping-craigslist-for-tickets/) for sold out concert tickets by Greg Reda. Using BeautifulSoup to parse HTML. AS a bonus, shows how to send yourself a text from Python, if you use Gmail & AT&T.
* [Web scraping in Python](Web scraping in Python) by me. Grabbing lacrosse scores and turning them into a CSV file.
