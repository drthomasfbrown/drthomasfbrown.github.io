## Origins
1. "Local color" journalism
2. Amateur historians-hypothesists
3. Salvage ethnography

##Early manifestations
- primarily in the eugenics literature

## Tri-Racial Studies Becomes "Scientific"
* emerges as empirical sociology in the 1930s and 40s.
* spreads to other disciplines in the 1950s
  * geography (eg, Price)
  * medicine (eg, Witkop)

## Tri-Racial studies disappears
- coincides with the end of Jim Crow; growing interest in ethnicity
- activist anthropology
- seems to decline in the mid-1960s as anthros come in
- gone altogether after the mid-1980s

## Research ideas

Needs a citation network analysis. Anyone want to work on it with me?

- snowball sample from known examples
- also check out Web of Science, SSCI, and Century of Social Science.
