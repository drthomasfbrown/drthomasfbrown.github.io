### [Commentpress](http://futureofthebook.org/commentpress/), a Wordpress plugin. Some nice examples in action:

- [The Historian's Macroscope](http://www.themacroscope.org/?p=1)
- [Holy of Holies](http://futureofthebook.org/mitchellstephens/holyofholies/) (appears to be an earlier theme, but I like it better than the current default.)

### [Scalar](http://scalar.usc.edu/)

- My first Scalar book: [UNOBTRUSIVE MEASURES ONLINE: OPEN SOURCE INTELLIGENCE FOR INVESTIGATORS AND SOCIAL SCIENTISTS](http://scalar.usc.edu/works/unobtrusive-measures-online/index)
