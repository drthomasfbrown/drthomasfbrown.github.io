Making audio sentence flashcards for Anki using Audacity.

Install Audacity. Install the LAME and FFmpeg after installing Audacity. LAME enables mp3 encoding. FFmpeg enables importing the audio tracks of video files.

Select your sentence by clicking and dragging inside the track.
Choose "Export slected audio" from the File menu to save your selection as an mp3.

A shortcut for exporting audio from Audacity is using labels. Highlight the portion you want to export then press Ctrl+B. Type the name you want for that chunk of audio then highlight the next chunk and repeat until everything you want is labeled. Afterwards, go to "Export Multiple Files" (Ctrl+Shift+L) and choose "Divide files by label" (or something along those lines). Each file will be exported using the label as the filename.
