Using Youtube to automate the subs2srs workflow

1) I have a video (even just an audio recording) and transcript, but no time code information. I will use Youtube to automatically generate time coded CCs. I upload the video or audio to Youtube.

2) In Youtube:

Select Create new subtitles or CC.

Underneath the video, click Transcribe and set timings.

Paste the transcript into the text field. 

Click Set timings to sync your transcript with the video.

Setting the timings can take a few minutes. While you wait, you'll be brought back to the video tracklist. Once it's ready, your transcription will automatically be published on your video.

3) Use keepsubs.com todownload the CC as a .srt file.

4) Generate Anki cards with subs2srs as normal.
