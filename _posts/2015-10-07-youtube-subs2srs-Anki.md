You can transcribe your video and automatically line up your text with the speech in the video. A transcript contains the text of what is said in a video, but no time code information, so you need to set the timing to sync with your video.

Note: Since the transcript text is automatically synchronized to your video, the transcript must be in a language supported by our speech recognition technology and in the same language that's spoken in the video. Transcripts are not recommended for videos that are over an hour long or have poor audio quality.

Select Create new subtitles or CC.
Underneath the video, click Transcribe and set timings.
Type all of the spoken audio in the text field. If you're creating closed captions, make sure to incorporate sound cues like [music] or [applause] to identify background sounds.
Click Set timings to sync your transcript with the video.
Setting the timings can take a few minutes. While you wait, you'll be brought back to the video tracklist. Once it's ready, your transcription will automatically be published on your video.

Hacking a bit 'you can also create a deck with YouTube videos, but we need to extract the subtitles and the video. I tried different solutions to find the process as easy as possible. To extract subtitles I used a program called [Google2srt](http://google2srt.sourceforge.net/en/) , very simple to use, for the videos I looked for a plugin that works.
Just the interface of YouTube has changed and most of the plugins are not working. I found Firefox works purely [Download Youtube Videos as MP4](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/download-youtube/)
